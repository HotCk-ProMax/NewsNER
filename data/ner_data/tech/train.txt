key	O
to	O
the	O
future	O
of	O
U.S.	O
military	O
weaponry.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
And	O
China,	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
threatens,	O
you	O
know,	O
the	O
wolf,	O
to	O
invade	O
Taiwan.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Mmhmm.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
And	O
some	O
people	O
say	O
the	O
whole	O
reason	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
hands	O
on	O
those	O
chips.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
That's	O
a	O
problem,	O
it's	O
a	O
risk,	O
it	O
makes	O
us	O
vulnerable.	O
The	O
problem	O
of	O
our	O
outsourcing	O
production	O
goes	O
way	O
beyond	O
high	O
tech	O
with	O
millions	O
of	O
American	O
workers	O
having	O
lost	O
their	O
jobs	O
that	O
went	O
overseas,	O
something	O
Raimondo	O
knows	O
first-hand	O
growing	O
up	O
as	O
the	O
youngest	O
child	O
in	O
an	O
Italian-American	O
family	O
in	O
Rhode	O
Island.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
old	O
Bulova	O
watch	O
factory	O
where	O
my	O
dad	O
worked	O
for	O
almost	O
30	O
years.	O
Her	O
dad	O
lost	O
his	O
job	O
when	O
Bulova	O
abandoned	O
the	O
factory	O
in	O
1983	O
and	O
moved	O
its	O
operations	O
to	O
China.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
It's	O
hard	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
imagine	O
it	O
now	O
as	O
you	O
look	O
around	O
here.	O
But	O
this	O
was,	O
you	O
know,	O
a	O
bustling	O
place.	O
You	O
know,	O
they	O
had	O
1,000	O
people	O
working	O
here,	O
food	O
trucks	O
on	O
the	O
sidewalk,	O
an	O
electroplating	O
shop	O
there,	O
a	O
tool	O
and	O
dye	O
shop	O
there.	O
And	O
now,	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
you	O
have.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
And	O
how	O
old	O
were	O
you?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
I	O
was	O
in,	O
like,	O
sixth	O
grade.	O
But	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
toll	O
it	O
took	O
on	O
my	O
dad	O
and	O
my	O
family.	O
And	O
that	O
influenced	O
her	O
career	O
choices	O
from	O
when	O
she	O
studied	O
economics	O
and	O
played	O
rugby	O
at	O
Harvard–	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
So,	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
office.	O
--to	O
when	O
she	O
left	O
a	O
high-paying	O
job	O
as	O
a	O
venture	O
capitalist	O
to	O
run	O
for	O
public	O
office	O
in	O
Rhode	O
Island.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
This	O
was	O
the	O
day	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
sworn	O
in	O
as	O
State	O
Treasurer,	O
and	O
those	O
are	O
my	O
parents.	O
That's	O
my	O
dad.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
That's	O
your	O
dad--	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Super	O
proud	O
of	O
me.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
--the	O
man	O
who	O
worked	O
at	O
Bulova.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
The	O
man	O
who	O
worked	O
at	O
Bulova.	O
The	O
man	O
who	O
taught	O
me	O
about	O
manufacturing,	O
tau--	O
taught	O
me	O
that	O
a	O
job	O
is	O
about	O
your	O
pride,	O
ability	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
your	O
family,	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
paycheck.	O
Married	O
with	O
two	O
children,	O
Raimondo--a	O
Rhodes	O
scholar	O
and	O
Yale	O
Law	O
School	O
graduate--was	O
elected	O
the	O
state's	O
first	O
female	O
governor	O
in	O
2014	O
as	O
a	O
moderate,	O
pro-business	O
Democrat.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
Liberals	O
in	O
your	O
party,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
quote,	O
look	O
upon	O
you	O
as	O
a	O
sellout	O
to	O
big	O
business.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
I	O
think	O
that's	O
ridiculous.	O
I	O
hold	O
businesses	O
accountable	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
anyone.	O
When	O
I	O
tell	O
them	O
they	O
can't	O
sell	O
their	O
semiconductors	O
to	O
China,	O
they	O
don't	O
love	O
that.	O
But	O
I	O
do	O
that.	O
In	O
late	O
2020,	O
President-elect	O
Joe	O
Biden	O
called	O
her	O
about	O
leading	O
the	O
Commerce	O
Department,	O
which	O
til	O
then	O
managed--without	O
much	O
fanfare	O
or	O
headlines--a	O
mishmash	O
of	O
agencies	O
and	O
assignments,	O
ranging	O
from	O
monitoring	O
the	O
weather	O
to	O
measuring	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
contaminants	O
in	O
household	O
dust.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
So,	O
one	O
day,	O
President-elect	O
Biden	O
calls	O
you	O
and	O
said,	O
"What	O
about	O
being	O
Commerce	O
Secretary?"	O
And	O
you	O
heard	O
that	O
and	O
thought?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
(laugh)	O
Init--	O
truthfully,	O
initially,	O
I	O
thought,	O
"What	O
does	O
the	O
Commerce	O
Secretary	O
do?"	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
Yeah.	O
(laugh)	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
And	O
then	O
the	O
president-elect	O
said	O
to	O
me,	O
"Come.	O
I	O
want	O
you	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
me	O
to	O
help	O
rebuild	O
American	O
manufacturing."	O
And	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
brother,	O
my	O
big	O
brother,	O
and	O
he	O
said,	O
"Gina,	O
dad	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
proud.	O
You	O
gotta	O
do	O
it.	O
You	O
gotta	O
do	O
it."	O
And	O
that	O
was	O
it.	O
Once	O
at	O
Commerce,	O
she	O
began	O
to	O
lean	O
on	O
Congress-	O
Gina	O
Raimondo	O
(during	O

This	O
is	O
just	O
good	O

--to	O

Gina	O
Raimondo	O
(during	O

It's	O
a	O
huge	O
day	O
for	O
the	O
entire	O

In	O
March,	O
in	O
Arizona,	O
she	O
announced	O
her	O
first	O

U.S.	O
to	O
Intel.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo	O
(during	O

We	O

our	O

to	O

$8.5	O

America's	O

She's	O

more	O
than	O
$20	O

Raimondo	O
is	O
also	O
spreading	O
her	O
largesse	O
elsewhere	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
another	O
huge	O

the	O
"Internet	O

Lesley	O
Stahl,	O
Commerce	O
Secretary	O
Gina	O
Raimondo	O
and	O
Corning	O
CEO	O
Wendell	O
Weeks	O
60	O
Minutes	O
We	O
went	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
a	O
Corning	O
factory	O
in	O
North	O
Carolina,	O
the	O
world's	O
largest	O
manufacturer	O
of	O

Wendell	O
Weeks:	O
You're	O
looking	O
at	O
fiber	O
on	O
these	O
spools,	O
all	O
different	O
colors.	O
What's	O
inside	O
of	O
there	O
is	O
actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
precise	O
products	O
ever	O
manufactured	O
by	O
man.	O
Wendell	O
Weeks,	O

and	O
CEO	O
of	O
Corning,	O
is	O
expanding	O
production	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
10	O
million	O
miles	O
of	O
new	O
cable	O
that's	O
needed	O
to	O
connect	O
the	O
24	O
million	O
Americans,	O

mostly	O
in	O
rural	O
America,	O
who	O
don't	O
have	O
access	O
to	O
high-speed	O

And	O
under	O
prodding	O
by	O
Raimondo,	O
he's	O
investing	O
Corning's	O
own	O
capital	O
to	O
do	O
it.	O
Wendell	O
Weeks:	O
We've	O
invested	O
another	O
half-billion	O
dollars	O
and	O
doubled	O
our	O
footprint	O
for	O
the	O
U.S.	O
Lesley	O

When	O
you're	O
spending	O
all	O
this	O
money	O
to	O
connect,	O
you	O
know,	O
small	O
numbers	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
live	O
miles	O
away,	O
the	O
expense	O
almost	O
doesn't	O
make	O
sense.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
It	O
does	O
make	O
sense.	O
The	O
internet	O
is	O
no	O
longer	O
a	O
luxury.	O
You	O
need	O
it	O
to	O
see	O
the	O

to	O
go	O
to	O

to	O
do	O
your	O

Everyone	O

Everyone	O

Together,	O

the	O

the	O
CHIPS	O

will	O
create	O
about	O
a	O
half-million	O

by	O
2030.	O
But	O
Wall	O

is	O
skeptical.	O
Intel,	O
for	O
example,	O
recently	O
reported	O
$7	O
billion	O
in	O

Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
When	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
pick	O
these	O
different	O
companies	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
money	O
to--	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Mmhmm.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
--it's,	O
it's	O
social,	O
industrial	O
policy,	O
something,	O
you	O
know,	O
we	O
gave	O
up	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
shown	O
that	O
private	O
industry	O
does	O
a	O
better	O
job	O
picking.	O
You're	O
smiling.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Well,	O
do	O
they?	O
Because	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
semiconductors	O
the	O
market	O
didn't	O
get	O
it	O
right.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
How	O
did	O
we	O
lose	O
this?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
We	O
allowed	O
manufacturing	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
to	O
wither	O
on	O
the	O
vine	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
cheaper	O
labor	O
in	O
Asia,	O
cheaper	O
capital	O
in	O
Asia,	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
are.	O
We	O
just	O
pursued	O
profit	O
over	O
national	O
security.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
There	O
are	O
strings	O
attached	O
to	O
these	O
grants.	O
They	O
have	O
to	O
provide	O
daycare.	O
You	O
want	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
diverse	O
workforce--	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Mmhmm.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
--be	O
union	O
workers?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
That	O
is	O
not	O
social	O
policy,	O
Lesley.	O
That's--	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
Sounds	O
like	O
it.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
--it's	O
math.	O
This	O
is	O
pure	O
math.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
What	O
do	O
you--	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
You	O
won't	O
have	O
enough	O
workers	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
job	O
unless	O
you	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
women	O
working	O
in	O
the	O
facilities.	O
What	O
I	O
am--	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
But--	O
but	O
on	O
that	O
point,	O
if	O
they	O
need	O
women--	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
Mmhmm.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
--and	O
women	O
need	O
daycare,	O
that's	O
a	O
decision	O
for	O
the	O
company	O
to	O
make.	O
Why	O
mandate	O
it	O
if	O
it's	O
what	O
they	O
need?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
It's	O
not	O
mandated.	O
To	O
be	O
clear,	O
these	O
are	O
not	O
mandates.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
But	O
it's	O
written	O
in	O
there.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
It	O
is	O
written.	O
But	O
you	O
know	O
what's	O
funny,	O
I	O
never	O
hear	O
complaints	O
about	O
this	O
from	O
the	O
companies.	O
The	O
only	O
complaints	O
I	O
have	O
are	O
from	O
politicians.	O
In	O
her	O
nearly	O
four	O
years	O
in	O
Washington,	O
Raimondo	O
has	O
elevated	O
the	O
Commerce	O
Department	O
and	O
its	O
secretary	O
into	O
a	O
high-profile	O
player.	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
China	O
wakes	O
up	O
every	O
day	O
figuring	O
out	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
around	O
our	O
regulations.	O
We	O
got	O
to	O
wake	O
up	O
every	O
day	O
that	O
much	O
more	O
relentless	O
and	O
aggressive.	O
So,	O
I	O
bring	O
it	O
every	O
day.	O
Lesley	O
Stahl:	O
So	O
here	O
comes	O
the	O
inevitable,	O
obvious	O
question	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
coming	O
your	O
way.	O
You	O
are	O
on	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
future	O
presidential	O
candidates.	O
Does	O
that	O
sound	O
good	O
to	O
you?	O
Is	O
it	O
appetizing?	O
Gina	O
Raimondo:	O
What	O
sounds	O
good	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
being	O
the	O
best	O
commerce	O
secretary	O
there's	O
ever	O
been.	O
One	O
qualification	O
for	O
high	O
office	O
is	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
duck	O
a	O
question	O
like	O
that.	O
Or	O
a	O
question	O
about	O
what	O
role	O
she	O
might	O

in	O
the	O
next	O

should	O
Kamala	O
Harris	O

the	O
White	O

Secretary	O

isn't	O
