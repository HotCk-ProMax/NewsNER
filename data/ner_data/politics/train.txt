of	O
prisoners.	O
On	O
two	O
occasions,	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
cram	O
in	O
here	O
in	O
an	O
apparent	O
rehearsal	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
death.	O
After	O
the	O
war,	O
in	O
1945,	O
the	O
British	O
military	O
investigated	O
the	O
camps,	O
and	O
put	O
the	O
death	O
toll	O
on	O
Alderney	O
in	O
the	O
low	O
hundreds.	O
Some	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
lost	O
their	O
lives	O
were	O
buried	O
under	O
this	O
plot	O
of	O
land.	O
But	O
Marcus	O
Roberts	O
and	O
others	O
argue	O
that	O
more	O
than	O
10,000	O
must	O
have	O
died	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
–	O
based	O
on	O
controversial	O
calculations	O
about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
labor	O
force	O
needed	O
to	O
build	O
the	O
fortifications.	O
Roberts	O
told	O
us	O
it's	O
because	O
he's	O
Jewish	O
that	O
he's	O
determined	O
to	O
count	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
dead.	O
Marcus	O
Roberts:	O
There	O
is	O
the--	O
the	O
Jewish	O
instinct	O
to,	O
you	O
know,	O
leave	O
no	O
one	O
behind	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
You're	O
trying	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
Jewish	O
dead	O
are	O
counted?	O
Marcus	O
Roberts:	O
Remembered.	O
If	O
you	O
don't	O
remember	O
a	O
life,	O
it's	O
as	O
if	O
they've	O
never	O
lived	O
at	O
all.	O
Most	O
academics	O
dispute	O
Roberts'	O
estimate	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
toll,	O
but	O
partly	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
those	O
disagreements,	O
last	O
year	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
appointed	O
a	O
team	O
of	O
researchers	O
to	O
comb	O
through	O
archives	O
across	O
Europe,	O
and	O
more	O
accurately	O
count	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
prisoners	O
who	O
died	O
on	O
Alderney.	O
Dr.	O
Gilly	O
Carr	O
--	O
an	O
archaeologist	O
at	O
Cambridge	O
University	O
--	O
is	O
coordinating	O
the	O
review.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
Why	O
is	O
this	O
just	O
a	O
document	O
search,	O
not	O
a	O
dig?	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
It	O
is	O
likely	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
mass	O
graves	O
were	O
Jewish.	O
And	O
according	O
to	O
Halakha	O
or	O
Jewish	O
law,	O
you	O
cannot	O
disturb	O
the	O
dead.	O
But	O
the	O
second	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
according	O
to	O
prisoner	O
statements,	O
some	O
people	O
were	O
dumped	O
at	O
sea	O
or	O
thrown	O
off	O
cliffs.	O
What	O
are	O
we	O
going	O
to	O
do?	O
Dig	O
up	O
the	O
entire	O
island?	O
Well,	O
we	O
can't	O
do	O
that.	O
The	O
researchers	O
are	O
drawing	O
on	O
rich	O
material.	O
The	O
Nazis	O
were	O
meticulous	O
record	O
keepers	O
--	O
and	O
British	O
archives	O
contain	O
first	O
hand	O
testimonies	O
from	O
survivors.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
Look	O
at	O
this.	O
"We	O
were	O
beaten	O
with	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
lay	O
their	O
hands	O
on:	O
with	O
sticks,	O
spades,	O
pickaxes."	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
It	O
sounds	O
absolutely	O
ghastly.	O
Dr.	O
Gilly	O
Carr	O
60	O
Minutes	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
"On	O
certain	O
days,	O
five	O
to	O
six,	O
up	O
to	O
10	O
men	O
died."	O
Dr.	O
Carr	O
told	O
us	O
there's	O
no	O
evidence	O
that	O
gas	O
chambers	O
were	O
used	O
on	O
Alderney	O
--	O
but	O
there	O
were	O
summary	O
executions,	O
and	O
the	O
prisoners	O
built	O
the	O
Nazi	O
fortifications	O
on	O
starvation	O
rations.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
Were	O
they	O
taken	O
to	O
Alderney	O
to	O
be	O
worked	O
to	O
death?	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
They	O
were	O
certainly	O
seen	O
as	O
expendable.	O
The	O
aim	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
every	O
ounce	O
of	O
work	O
out	O
of	O
them.	O
And	O
if	O
they	O
died,	O
it	O
didn't	O
matter,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
perhaps	O
"expected."	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
They	O
were	O
disposable	O
human	O
beings.	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
Yes.	O
Yes.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
How	O
did	O
your	O
father	O
end	O
up	O
in	O
Alderney?	O
At	O
a	O
pub	O
in	O
the	O
Channel	O
Islands,	O
we	O
met	O
Gary	O
Font.	O
His	O
father	O
–	O
Francisco	O
Font	O
–	O
fought	O
on	O
the	O
losing	O
side	O
in	O
the	O
Spanish	O
Civil	O
War,	O
was	O
arrested	O
in	O
France,	O
handed	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
Germans,	O
and	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
concentration	O
camp	O
on	O
Alderney.	O
Francisco	O
survived,	O
and	O
later	O
married	O
a	O
British	O
woman	O
--	O
Gary's	O
mother.	O
Holly	O
Williams	O
and	O
Gary	O
Font	O
60	O
Minutes	O
Gary	O
Font:	O
He	O
witnessed--	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
a	O
young	O
Soviet	O
boy	O
who	O
decided	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
working	O
detail	O
and	O
to	O
change	O
his	O
footwear.	O
So	O
he	O
started	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
these	O
paper	O
bags,	O
and	O
wrap	O
them	O
'round	O
his	O
feet,	O
and	O
then	O
tie	O
them	O
with	O
string.	O
And	O
a	O
SS	O
guard	O
had	O
seen	O
him	O
do	O
this,	O
and	O
walked	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
and--	O
and	O
shot	O
him--	O
point-blank	O
range.	O
Gary	O
told	O
us	O
his	O
father's	O
experiences	O
left	O
him	O
scarred.	O
Gary	O
Font:	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
emotion	O
on	O
his	O
face.	O
Yeah,	O
it's	O
a	O
tough	O
one.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
Do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
emotion	O
came	O
from--	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
survived	O
the	O
War	O
in	O
Spain,	O
and	O
survived	O
the	O
camp	O
here?	O
Gary	O
Font:	O
Yeah,	O
exactly.	O
That	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
realized,	O
"Wow,	O
you	O
know,	O
this	O
man	O
has	O
a	O
deep-rooted	O
emotion	O
inside	O
of	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
get	O
out."	O
The	O
British	O
government's	O
effort	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
truth	O
out	O
–	O
by	O
recounting	O
the	O
dead	O
–	O
was	O
commissioned	O
by	O
Lord	O
Pickles	O
–	O
a	O
former	O
cabinet	O
minister	O
and	O
now	O
the	O
U.K.'s	O
envoy	O
for	O
post-Holocaust	O
issues.	O
Lord	O
Pickles:	O
The	O
figures	O
vary,	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
hundred,	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
thousand,	O
by--	O
by	O
tens	O
of	O
thousands.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
So	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
controversy	O
that	O
prompted	O
you	O
to	O
commission	O
the	O
review?	O
Lord	O
Pickles:	O
Yes.	O
It	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
sensible	O
thing	O
was,	O
"Well,	O
okay.	O
Let's	O
do	O
that--	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
open.	O
Let's	O
do	O
it	O
fully	O
transparent.	O
He's	O
also	O
asked	O
the	O
researchers	O
to	O
put	O
names	O
to	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
those	O
killed	O
as	O
they	O
can.	O
Lord	O
Pickles:	O
If	O
you	O
remember	O
them	O
as	O
individuals,	O
then	O
it's	O
another	O
blow	O
against	O
Hitler.	O
Hitler	O
wanted	O
to	O
eradicate	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
people.	O
60	O
Minutes	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
So	O
this	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
ongoing	O
fight	O
against	O
Hitler	O
and	O
his	O
ideas?	O
Lord	O
Pickles:	O
Hitler's	O
evil	O
hand	O
still	O
continues	O
to	O
affect--	O
to	O
affect	O
Europe	O
and	O
to	O
affect	O
the	O
world.	O
But	O
it's	O
taken	O
nearly	O
80	O
years	O
for	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
to	O
re-examine	O
what	O
happened	O
on	O
Alderney	O
--	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
its	O
report	O
public.	O
The	O
official	O
British	O
investigations	O
in	O
1945	O
were	O
classified	O
for	O
decades.	O
And	O
unlike	O
the	O
trials	O
of	O
Nazi	O
officials	O
in	O
Nuremberg	O
--	O
the	O
British	O
authorities	O
failed	O
to	O
prosecute	O
a	O
single	O
German	O
officer	O
who	O
worked	O
on	O
Alderney	O
–	O
even	O
though	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
ended	O
up	O
in	O
British	O
prisoner	O
of	O
war	O
camps.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
I	O
mean	O
just	O
to	O
be	O
clear,	O
these	O
are	O
possible	O
war	O
criminals.	O
The	O
British	O
government	O
has	O
gathered	O
evidence	O
against--	O
against	O
them.	O
And	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
British	O
custody.	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
Yes,	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
this	O
point,	O
yes.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
A	O
sort	O
of	O
slam-dunk	O
case?	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
You'd	O
have	O
thought.	O
That's	O
led	O
Marcus	O
Roberts	O
and	O
others	O
to	O
claim	O
that	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
tried	O
to	O
cover-up	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
atrocities	O
on	O
Alderney.	O
Dr.	O
Carr	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
true	O
--	O
but	O
one	O
key	O
document	O
from	O
the	O
British	O
War	O
Office	O
investigation	O
that	O
may	O
explain	O
why	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
prosecutions	O
is	O
missing.	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
It	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
shredded--	O
decades	O
ago	O
as	O
part	O
of,	O
"What	O
do	O
we	O
need	O
these	O

for	O

Holly	O
Williams:	O
But	O
could	O
it	O
also	O
have	O
been	O
shredded	O
for	O
more	O
nefarious	O
purposes?	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
idea.	O
In	O
order	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
say	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
cover-up,	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
decisions	O
taken.	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
look	O
through	O
those	O
steps	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
my	O
own	O
mind.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
Why	O
might	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
have	O
tried	O
to	O
cover	O
up	O
or	O
whitewash	O
what	O
happened	O
on	O
Alderney	O
and--	O
and	O
maybe	O
more	O
broadly,	O
on	O
the	O
Channel	O
Islands?	O
Gilly	O
Carr:	O
There	O
are	O
some	O
things	O
that--	O
that	O
happened	O
that	O
might	O
not--	O
that	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
might	O
not	O
necessarily	O
have	O
wanted	O
a	O
wider	O
audience	O
to	O

about.	O
Those	O
things	O
–	O
once	O

When	O
the	O

At	O
the	O

That's	O
my	O

I	O
suspect	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
probably	O
quite	O
steely.	O
One	O

of	O
the	O

was	O

in	O
her	O

for	O
nearly	O
two	O

Jenny	O

told	O

when	O
her	O

Louisa	O
was	O

she	O
was	O

She	O
was	O

to	O

yeah.	O
Holly	O
Williams:	O
After	O
the	O

did	O
the	O

get	O
in	O

Jenny	O
Lecoat:	O
The	O
British	O
government,	O
I	O
think,	O
were	O
kind	O
of	O
ashamed.	O
They	O
were	O
horrified	O
it	O
had	O
happened,	O
and	O
they	O
didn't	O

about	O

at	O
all?	O
Jenny	O
Lecoat:	O
Well,	O
it	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
mixed	O
picture.	O
There	O
were	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
resisted	O
the	O

as	O
much	O
as	O
resistance	O
was	O
possible	O
within	O
a	O
tiny,	O
nine-by-five-mile	O

And	O
there	O
were	O
also	O
people	O
who'd	O
collaborated.	O
Some	O
people	O
had	O
betrayed	O
their	O
own	O
country.	O
The	O
only	O
possible	O
legislation	O
was	O
treason,	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
hanging	O

They	O
didn't	O

That	O
was	O
the	O

60	O

More	O
of	O
that	O
