# NewsNER

NewsNER is a project to extract cross-domain multimodal named entity recognition datasets from news articles, including crawlers, classifiers, and BERT entity recognition parts. NewsNER is a subproject of [CMNER](https://github.com/HotCk-ProMax/CMNER) and also contains scripts for converting data to CMNER input format.

Run "run.py" to complete the task. You can enter each script to modify the save path or change the number of news crawled. Specify the script to be run in "run.py".
